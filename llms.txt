# Mnemox

> Trading Decision Intelligence. Open-source MCP tools for AI agents — memory systems and pre-build validation. Built in Taiwan.

Mnemox builds open-source infrastructure for AI-assisted decision making. We focus on two product lines:

1. **Idea Reality Check** (idea-reality-mcp) — An MCP tool that scans GitHub, Hacker News, npm, PyPI, and Product Hunt before you build. Returns a 0-100 reality signal with evidence of existing competitors. Used by AI coding agents to prevent reinventing the wheel.

2. **TradeMemory Protocol** — A platform-agnostic 3-layer memory system for AI trading agents. Provides structured trade storage (L1 raw trades, L2 patterns, L3 strategy) with LLM-powered reflection capabilities. Accepts data from MT5, Binance, Alpaca, or any trading platform.
